This is my implementation of the ["Build Your Own HTTP server" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/http-server/overview).

I built a very simple HTTP/1.1 server that can serve multiple clients concurrently with threading, handle gzip compression of the response body, read and process a select few request headers, save the contents of the request body to a file and also read a file and send the contents to the client in the response body.

**Note**: Head over to [codecrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io) to try the challenge yourself.
